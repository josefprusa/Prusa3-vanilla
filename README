To start:
You can configure belt teeths in x-carriage and y-belt-holder by changing `belt_tooth_distance` parameter and by adjusting `position_tweak`.

Then, simply type `make` to compile your own STL files.

Aim for 0.3mm layers and 2.2 extrusion width (width over thickness),
for 0.66mm stroke width. Printer is tested at this setting.

Also testing at 1.4 extrusion width for T2.5 belt configuration.

== Notes about the fork ==

This fork is intended for to maintain a more normalized version of the original «vanilla». This means:

* Only M3x10mm and M3x20mm screws to mount the complete printer and 2 M3x30mm to add the extruder to x-carriage.

* Fix some different sizes in similar parts

* TODO: Extruder modification to be 608 & hobbed bolt compatible

* ...
